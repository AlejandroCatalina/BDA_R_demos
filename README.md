# Bayesian Data Analysis R Demos

This repository contains some R demos for the book [Bayesian Data
Analysis, 3rd ed by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, and Rubin (BDA3)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/).

Currently there are demos for BDA3 Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 and
11. Furthermore there are demos for
[RStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan) and
[RStanARM](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstanarm).

The initial demos were originally written for Matlab by [Aki
Vehtari](http://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) and translated to R by [Markus
Paasiniemi](https://github.com/paasim). Recebtly more demos have been
added for RStan and RStanARM.
