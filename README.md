# Bayesian Data Analysis R Demos

This repository contains some R demos for the book [Bayesian Data
Analysis, 3rd ed by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, and Rubin (BDA3)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/).

Currently there are demos for BDA3 Chapter 2 (and demos for chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 and 11 coming)

The demos were originally written for Matlab by [Aki
Vehtari](http://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) and translated to R by
Markus Paasiniemi
