# Bayesian Data Analysis R Demos

This repository contains some R demos for the book [Bayesian Data
Analysis, 3rd ed by Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, and Rubin (BDA3)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/).

Currently there are demos for BDA3 Chapters 2, 3, 4, 6, 6, 10 and 11. Furthermore there is a demo for [RStan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan).

The demos were originally written for Matlab by [Aki
Vehtari](http://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) and translated to R by
[Markus Paasiniemi](https://github.com/paasim).

The corresponding [Matlab/Octave demos](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_m_demos)
and the corresponding [Python demos](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_py_demos).
